# Social Networks Analysis in Sports Teams

## Project Overview
This project explores the social structures within two Columbia University sports teams: the Men's Rugby Club and the Lightweight Rowing Team. Utilizing social network analysis, the study aims to uncover the intricate social dynamics and differences between these teams, providing insights into how team structures and practices impact social connections and team cohesion.

## Installation
1. Install R and RStudio (or any other R environment).
2. Install the `igraph` package.
3. Clone or download this repository.

## Usage
1. Open the R scripts (`Rowing_graph.r` or `Rugby_graph.r`) in your R environment.
2. Modify the file paths to the CSV files as per your local setup.
3. Run the scripts to generate social network visualizations and analyses for each team.

## Project Description
- **Rugby Team Analysis**: Focuses on the hierarchical structure of the team and explores how practice routines and team divisions (A team vs. B team) affect social ties.
- **Rowing Team Analysis**: Examines the more uniform and cohesive structure of the rowing team, influenced by their rigorous training schedule and team dynamics.

## Methodology
The project employs social network analysis techniques, using surveys to create complete graphs representing the teams' social structures. The analysis includes measuring closeness and interaction frequency among team members.

## Findings and Implications
The study reveals significant differences in the social structures of the two college sports teams, influenced by their respective coaching styles and team practices. These insights are crucial for understanding team dynamics and can inform future strategies in team management and cohesion building.
